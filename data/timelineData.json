    "content": "In 2000, broadband internet made its debut in the UK. Cable operator Telewest rolled out the first consumer ADSL service on 31 March, connecting homes at speeds up to 512 kbps. This “always-on” broadband access began replacing slow dial-up modems, though uptake was initially modest. Around the same time, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 came into force, providing a legal framework for intercepting online communications. These developments marked the start of Britain’s high-speed internet era and the first steps in internet regulation.",

Telecom regulator Oftel (predecessor to Ofcom) allowed rival providers to install their own equipment in BT’s local telephone exchanges. LLU was slow to take off at first – by mid-2005 only about 70,000 lines had been unbundled but it eventually revolutionised home internet. By 2010, over 7 million broadband lines were unbundled, leading to lower prices, faster ADSL2+ services, and a much more competitive UK broadband market.",

That draft bill (which would have required ISPs to store everyone’s browsing history) sparked widespread privacy objections and was ultimately shelved. In short, 2012 saw the UK embrace new technology (4G) even as it grappled with the balance between security and privacy online.",

DRIPA was controversial and quickly challenged in court for infringing privacy, but it temporarily preserved law enforcement’s data access pending more comprehensive legislation (which arrived two years later).",
